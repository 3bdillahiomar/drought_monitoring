Drought poses a significant challenge to countries in the horn of Africa causing widespread impacts on the environment and economies. In Northern Kenya, drought is a persistent and impactful environmental phenomenon that poses significant challenges to the region's communities and ecosystems. Characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions, Northern Kenya is prone to erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged dry spells, making the area vulnerable to recurrent drought events.

Drought monitoring is a crucial aspect of drought management, as it provides decision -makers with the information needed to implement mitigation strategies, allocate resources, and support affected communities. Advances in technology, including the use of satellite imagery, remote sensing, and sophisticated modeling techniques, have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of drought monitoring systems in recent years.
